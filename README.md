Insights 
✔ 1. Which customer segment buys the most?

-> Based on the “Products Sold by Location” chart:
Kolkata customers buy the most, followed by Delhi and Mumbai.
Skincare contributes heavily to this high demand.

Haircare ranks second; Cosmetics perform the lowest.

✔ 3. What causes delays — shipping, production, or suppliers?
